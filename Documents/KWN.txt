TOP SECRET

I have embedded Kuweni’s story into the training module for the new recruits.

Lesson 1: Power is not given. It is taken.

Lesson 2: Deception is not weakness. It is design.

Lesson 3: The most powerful agents are the ones whose stories you erase.

Kuweni understood this. She changed the course of Sri Lankan history - not with an army, but with knowledge.

I will encode her story into our comms system. If one day our data is found, they will read Kuweni’s myth as poetry. But it will be more than that.

It will be our manifesto.
