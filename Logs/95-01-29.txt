Found somewhere secure to rest. I can't reveal it now. The house is old and big. Enough to keep people away. I will be alone for awhile.  

The caretaker doesn't speak much. I think he knows I’m not just another engineering dropout.

My room is small—just a bed, a two desks. Only some of my books here. The rest I had to leave behind.
