It’s time.

I’ve triggered the final lock. The FTP is secured. I uploaded what I have and know. No one will find it easily. But maybe you will.

If you're reading this... don’t let this rot in silence. Tell the world what was done in the shadows.

What I have gathered is yours now. Assemble your team, make it your MISSION to EXPOSE everything.

=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=

I don't know who said that but, this is what I leave you with. 

DO WHAT IS TAKES TO SHARE EVERTHING!
