# The Story of Yogeshwari: A Ghost in the Machine

*A comprehensive analysis of stealth technology, surveillance, and the woman who became invisible*

---

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the complete story of **Yogeshwari** - a brilliant Tamil woman engineer from the University of Moratuwa who became entangled in the Sri Lankan civil war (1983-2009), working on stealth submarine technology while grappling with identity, betrayal, and the realization that the war itself was a manipulation.

The story was discovered through a series of documents found on an old FTP server, accessed using the password **WEAREONE** (posted day by day by Charitha Athalage).

## üìù Note

This story is based on documents discovered through FTP access to IP 124.43.10.152. The authenticity and context of these documents should be considered within the framework of the Sri Lankan civil war period (1983-2009) and the technological capabilities of the 1990s.

The message **WE ARE ONE** serves as both a password and a philosophy - a call to transcend artificial divisions and recognize our shared humanity.
