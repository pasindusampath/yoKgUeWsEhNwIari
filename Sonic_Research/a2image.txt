Experiment: Embedding grayscale image data into an audio spectrogram.
Steps:

Converted .bmp to raw byte array (values 0â€“255).

Mapped brightness to frequency and time (vertical = pitch, horizontal = time).

Rendered a 2-second .wav file using custom BASIC script.

Played file and viewed waveform through oscilloscope (CRT mod).

Results:

- Visual patterns appear faintly.

- Fine detail lost in low frequencies.

Viewing via CRT tube gives clearer outlines than analog scope.
