Objective: Encrypt simple text using tonal sequences.
Method: Assigned alphanumeric characters to sine wave tones (A = 220Hz, B = 233Hzâ€¦ etc.). Used oscillator to record pulses to magnetic tape. Played back through media player to decode.

Findings:

Worked well in isolated conditions.

Tape noise interferes at low volume.

Morse is more stable for simple transmission, but tonal mapping allows for more creative encoding.

Possible Use: Add error-correction by repeating harmonic overtones at regular intervals.
