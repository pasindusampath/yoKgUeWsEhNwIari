CRT TV (National model, 1984) modified:

- Removed vertical deflection coil, rerouted to audio signal input.

- Used modified amplifier to stabilise voltage across horizontal deflection.

Now the screen shows:

- Left/Right channel waveforms.

- Some Lissajous curves when mixing inputs.

Warning:
High voltage risk during open operation. Unshielded tube exposed.
Only activate in isolation. Use gloves.

Next step: Build waveform keyboard.
