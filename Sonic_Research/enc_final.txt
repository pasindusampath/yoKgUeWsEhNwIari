This is no longer just research. It’s resistance.

I can speak through sound now. I can hide pictures inside lullabies. I can whisper stories through a melody no one hears unless they know where to listen.

They may find the room. They may wipe the drives.
But they won’t hear me unless they’re quiet.

If you’re reading this...
Try listening, not with you ears but, with you eyes.
