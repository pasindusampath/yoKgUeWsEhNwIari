Old Casio keyboard modified.

Removed tone ROM and rewired key matrix to send direct frequency pulses into audio encoder (via DIN port). Keys now output pure sine tones in specific frequency band (200Hzâ€“2kHz).

Added:

- Further tonal distortion in the frequency. This make the audible sound difficult to decipher. 

- Keyboard output connected directly to the CRT.

Notes:

- Chord patterns will confuse the decoding. Single keys are clear at the moment.

- My team enjoys playing with it. They ask me what the symbols mean. Everyone will know, one day. 

- Recorded a 5 note sequence to tape.
