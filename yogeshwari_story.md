# The Story of Yogeshwari: A Ghost in the Machine

*A tale of stealth, surveillance, and the woman who became invisible*

---

## Prologue: The Discovery

The password was simple: **WEAREONE**.

It appeared day by day, posted by someone called Charitha Athalage. An IP address. A username. And then, hidden in the depths of an old FTP server, a treasure trove of documents that would reveal one of the most remarkable stories of the Sri Lankan civil war.

This is the story of Yogeshwari - a Tamil woman engineer who became a ghost in the machine, a whisper in the silence, and ultimately, a voice for unity in a time of division.

## Chapter 1: The Myth of Kuweni

*"Kuweni. Not a myth. A mirror."*

In the ancient chronicles of Sri Lanka, there is a story of a yakshini - a demon woman - who met the first Sinhalese king, Vijaya, on a mountain. She gave him everything: her knowledge, her loyalty, her body. She helped him establish his kingdom. And when the time came to claim her place in the new world she had helped build, she was cast out like a shadow no one wanted to remember.

Her name was Kuweni.

For a young Tamil woman studying engineering at the University of Moratuwa in 1992, Kuweni's story was more than mythology. It was a mirror.

"I have read the Mahavamsa a dozen times and still I keep returning to the same passage," she would write later. "They never quite define her. And that's exactly why she haunts me."

The young engineer saw herself in Kuweni's fate. An outsider. A woman with knowledge. Destined to be erased from history.

But unlike Kuweni, she would not go quietly.

She would become Yogeshwari - the goddess of control, of inner strength, of unseen power.

## Chapter 2: The Engineer

*March 1992 - University of Moratuwa*

The memo arrived on March 11, 1992. A simple internal communication from the Department of Mechanical Engineering to Dr. D. Weeraratne.

"Please ensure postgraduate research involving composite marine hull structures is registered with the university archive and access is controlled. Under recent agreements, we are to maintain ethical and transparent boundaries in all defence-adjacent research."

It was not a reprimand. It was a precautionary reminder.

But for the young Tamil woman working on her thesis, it was a warning. Her research into composite materials for marine applications was being watched. The university was under surveillance.

She was developing something revolutionary - a layered composite hull that could absorb sound, making submarines virtually undetectable. Fibreglass outer shell, jute mesh, rubberised latex, foam resin core. The combination could reduce acoustic signature by over 60% in saltwater.

But there was a problem. The organic fiber began degrading after 12 weeks. She needed to solve this. She needed to make something truly invisible.

The young engineer didn't know it yet, but her research would become the foundation for stealth technology that would change the course of a war.

## Chapter 3: The Camp

*May 1994 - Northwestern Province*

The camp was operational.

Four young recruits, eager and nervous, gathered in a small space in the Northwestern Province. The coordinates were redacted, but the location was secure. They had the tools. They had the knowledge. And they had a leader who would teach them everything.

The hull prototype was finally ready for cold water conditions. Layered composite materials, each layer designed to absorb and dampen sound. The outer shell of marine-grade fibreglass, the inner layers of jute mesh and rubberised latex, the core of foam resin.

It was beautiful in its simplicity. And terrifying in its potential.

"I sleep in a corner behind the rigging frame," Yogeshwari wrote in her log. "I dream of silence so complete, it drowns fear."

The recruits were learning fast. Amaran, the nervous one, kept asking if the sub would float. Yogeshwari's answer was always the same: "It's not meant to float. It's meant to disappear."

But the silence they were building was not just physical. It was also digital.

## Chapter 4: The Encryption

*December 1994 - The Resistance Begins*

"This is no longer just research. It's resistance."

The realization came in December 1994. The young engineer had been working on audio encryption systems, developing methods to hide messages in sound. Tonal sequences where A equaled 220Hz, B equaled 233Hz, and so on. Morse code embedded in reversed sine wave harmonics. Messages layered in spectrograms, visible only when slowed down four times.

She had modified an old Casio keyboard, rewired the key matrix to send direct frequency pulses into an audio encoder. The keys now output pure sine tones in the 200Hz to 2kHz range. She had modified a CRT TV to visualize the waveforms, removed the vertical deflection coil and rerouted it to audio signal input.

"I can speak through sound now," she wrote. "I can hide pictures inside lullabies. I can whisper stories through a melody no one hears unless they know where to listen."

The technology was revolutionary. But it was also dangerous.

"They may find the room. They may wipe the drives. But they won't hear me unless they're quiet."

The young engineer was becoming something else. She was becoming a ghost in the machine.

## Chapter 5: The Hunt

*November 1994 - December 1994*

The shadows appeared in November.

Yogeshwari had started recording the night sounds. Mostly frogs, but sometimes she caught a low hum, too perfect to be natural. Might be diesel. Could be coastal patrols. Or worse.

Reversing the audio revealed a faint rhythmic echo every 13 seconds. If someone was tracking them, they were doing it from a distance.

The shadows came in December. They appeared behind the trees, disappearing when torches were shone on them. No sound, no footprints, no traces. Were they going mad?

"I feel we are watched," Yogeshwari wrote. "We have to leave."

The pressure was mounting. They were comparing their work to Shankar's vessels - the fast, fierce LTTE Sea Tiger boats. "What we're building here is quieter. Smaller. But they all believe it'll be remembered longer."

Sometimes she wondered: would this be their legacy or their shadow?

The decision was made. They had to evacuate. But first, they would leave traces for anyone who wanted to find them.

## Chapter 6: The Escape

*January 1995 - The Safe House*

The escape was planned carefully. Yogeshwari packed only the schematics and the coded tapes. She would leave one tape for anyone who wanted to find her.

"They're too close now," she wrote in her final log before departure. "Will have to head closer to the capital."

But before leaving, she set up a relay to an FTP node. Powered it via modem burst. She would be watching.

The safe house was an old building, big enough to keep people away. The caretaker didn't speak much, but Yogeshwari thought he knew she wasn't just another engineering dropout.

Her room was small - just a bed and two desks. Only some of her books were there. The rest she had to leave behind.

Each morning, she walked to a paddy field down the road and sat by the well, watching the rays of sun peak over the coconut trees. She ran into a man there who asked her for the time. She told him, and thought to herself it could be this time forever.

Back in her room, she opened her books to find more answers. Where do I go from here?

## Chapter 7: The Watcher Watched

*March 1995 - May 1995*

The discovery came in March.

Yogeshwari's intuition had been right. Someone was watching their abandoned site. They had deployed a camera system - experimental, black and white, with infrared sensors. She traced it and unmasked the IP: 124.43.10.152.

They had blocked access to it.

But Yogeshwari was not easily deterred. By April, she had found the login information. The username was "antariksa" - Sanskrit for "space/cosmos." Why would they use a Sanskrit word for the name?

She used paintbrush to store the password. The technology of the time still could not read text from images. She could see their old hideout through the cameras. How did they do this?

The other cameras needed another passkey.

By May, she had cracked it. Five additional cameras with interior feed and thermal overlays. Movement at night. They had been all over the hideout.

But this was not military. Too careful. Not LTTE. Too quiet.

"State. Deep."

A third entity was watching everyone.

## Chapter 8: The Awakening

*The Philosophical Transformation*

The realization came gradually, through intercepted messages and frequencies, through the shape of something else that began to emerge.

"I used to believe in 'sides,'" Yogeshwari would write later. "Sinhala vs Tamil. North vs South. Colonised vs Coloniser."

But the deeper she went, the more frequencies she tapped, the more intercepted messages she heard, the more she saw the shape of something else.

A game.

"They fed us myths. Made us fight each other so no one would ever fight them."

The war was never theirs. It was a program.

The betrayal was everywhere. Vijaya betrayed Kuweni. The LTTE betrayed its children. The Government betrayed its soldiers. She betrayed herself.

"I used to encrypt intelligence. Now I decrypt history."

The divide was the weapon.

"There are no sides. There is only the story we've been told to believe."

But when she saw the face of a mother on either side of the line, crying the same tears, she realized:

"We are not enemies. We are mirrors. We are one."

## Chapter 9: The Final Message

*October 1996 - The Upload*

The message came in October 1996. An intercepted communication from someone called "Prof." Yogeshwari knew he wanted her found.

She saved it. She didn't want to decode it.

It was the last she heard of him.

But the message contained something else. When decoded, it revealed coordinates: 7.023715, 79.952079. And a confession.

"I knew. The moment I saw the image in that article. It matched her prototype. The curvature. The layering. Her thesis was brilliant. Her thesis was used. My son died in Kilinochchi. And now I wonder if my lectures helped build the weapon that ended him. I taught her to make something quiet. She made a ghost."

The professor's son had died in the conflict. The knowledge he had taught her had been weaponized. The guilt was overwhelming.

But Yogeshwari had made her choice. She was no longer fighting for land. She was fighting for truth.

For the girl in Jaffna who wanted to paint. For the boy in Galle who wanted to build robots. For the mothers who buried their sons with no flag on their graves.

"I betray division. I betray hate. And I fight for what is most dangerous to tyrants: The idea that WE ARE ONE."

## Chapter 10: The Final Lock

*October 7, 1996*

"It's time."

Yogeshwari had triggered the final lock. The FTP was secured. She uploaded what she had and knew. No one would find it easily. But maybe someone would.

"If you're reading this... don't let this rot in silence. Tell the world what was done in the shadows."

What she had gathered was now theirs. Assemble your team, make it your MISSION to EXPOSE everything.

The final message was clear:

"All that is required for the triumph of evil is that good men remain silent and do nothing."

She didn't know who said that, but this is what she left them with.

"DO WHAT IT TAKES TO SHARE EVERYTHING!"

The password was simple: **WEAREONE**.

## Epilogue: The Legacy

*Present Day*

The files were discovered decades later. The IP address still active. The username still valid. The password hidden in plain sight.

Charitha Athalage had posted it day by day: **WEAREONE**.

The story of Yogeshwari - the Tamil woman engineer who became a ghost in the machine - was finally revealed. Her stealth technology, her audio encryption, her surveillance countermeasures, her philosophical transformation.

But most importantly, her message: **WE ARE ONE**.

The war was not about sides. It was about manipulation. The divide itself was the weapon. The revolution begins when we stop listening to the lies that say we are different.

Yogeshwari is not dead. She is code. She is cipher. She is the whisper that outlives the war.

If her signal reached you, know that she is no longer fighting for land. She is fighting for truth.

For the girl in Jaffna who wants to paint. For the boy in Galle who wants to build robots. For the mothers who buried their sons with no flags on their graves.

Let them label her a traitor again. But this time, she betrays division. She betrays hate.

And she fights for what is most dangerous to tyrants:

The idea that **WE ARE ONE**.
